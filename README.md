This is an open-source app designed to review and rate public toilets. The main objective of this app is to encourage owners and users to maintain cleanliness in public toilets. It also features navigation to the toilets and a tipping feature to contribute or donate to the owners.

## Tech Stack

This project uses the MERN stack:
- **MongoDB**: A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program for storage.
- **Express.js**: A back end web application framework for Node.js for building web applications and APIs.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

## Features

- **Toilet Reviews and Ratings**: Users can review and rate public toilets based on their cleanliness, facilities, and overall experience.
- **Navigation**: The app provides directions to the nearest public toilets.
- **Tips and Donations**: Users can contribute or donate to the toilet owners to support maintenance and cleanliness.

## Getting Started

## Usage 

After installing the app, users can create an account to access all features. Users can search for public toilets in their vicinity, view ratings and reviews, and get navigation directions. After visiting a toilet, users can leave their own rating and review. If they found the toilet well-maintained, they can leave a tip for the owner.
